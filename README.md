# neural network on tabular data 
This notebook implementation is based off on using multi-layer perceptron from the pytorch 
framework to predict a class on a tabular dataset. It implements different preprocessings using
pytorch on tabular dataset such as sampling a subset from the train, test and validation dataloader
due to high data dimension.
